This assingment is simply implementing a basic chatroom.
It can accept maximum 255 participants. If the chatroom is full, the client will 
receive a message that the server is full, then the client will be disconnected.
When client connects to a non-full server, it will prompt the user to provide a 
unique username, which can not be longer than 10 characters and whitespace is
not accepted. If the username provided is invalid. it will prompt the user to 
provide a new username. If the user does provide the username within 60 seconds, 
the connection will be closed on the particpant. After receiving a valid username, 
the user will become an active participant and he can send a message up to 1000
characters at any time. Also a message about the user has joined will be send to 
all participant in the chatroom. If the user left the chatroom, a message about 
who has left will be send to all users in the chatroom. This chatroom will handle 
two different types of mesaages:public message and private message. For private
message, user need to use "@ username", which the username is the intended 
recipient. If the message doesn't start with @ then it is a public message.
Public message will be showed to all the participants in the chatroom and private
message will be only seen by the sender and intended receipient.

I think the hardest part will be handling public and private message.  Also this 
time the clients can leave anytime as they want, it may be also difficult to 
make sure that the server knows there is someone left and allowed other new 
clients to join.

Three resources that I plan to user:
Office hour
